          The English songs in the Our Music Time course materials are more
          difficult for children and teachers to learn in Taiwan. How to
          overcome it?

          <p>
            Zoltán Kodály has always advocated learning music in the mother
            tongue, especially folk songs passed down from generation to
            generation. If children learn these folk songs, they should use the
            original language to learn the essence of music; in contrast, when
            children learn Chinese folk songs abroad, they also hope to learn in
            Chinese.

            My suggestion is not. As mentioned above, the reason is to let
            students feel the original meaning of the lyrics. The teachers can
            translate in advance to let students understand before teaching them
            to sing.

            The Kodály Method has always emphasized that children must undergo
            three procedures (3 Ps) to learn a new topic: Prepare, Present, and
            Practice. The teachers notice the ‘Present' appearing in one of the
            activities in the lesson plan. They must bring this subject into the
            individual piano lessons because the themes learned through these
            three procedures can allow students to understand the subject's
            meaning cognitively.

            The proportion of instrument lessons in Our Music Time lesson plans
            can increase according to the children's learning ability. Suppose a
            piano lesson is 60 minutes weekly for beginners or under five. In
            that case, the children can have 10-20 minutes for piano learning,
            and the remaining 40-50 minutes will focus on the Our Music Time
            curriculum.

            Parents nowadays want their children to learn instruments quickly.
            ‘Learning slowly’ lays a good foundation for children to learn
            music, focusing on the three essential elements of music: beat,
            rhythm, and intonation, so that the children can learn instruments
            from complicated to simple and make the most neglected experiment.
            Singing and listening to music should be established first, then
            instrument learning.

          <p>
            Learning all aspects of music has always been our central
            philosophy. Through singing, tapping, the beat, and clapping the
            rhythm, children's brain integration ability is trained so that the
            left brain controls the right side of the body. Then, the right
            brain controls the left body and uses the integration ability of the
            brain to learn instrumental music. For example, the stability of the
            playing speed does not have to rely on the metronome or the practice
            of finger skills and musical expression. One's brain can control it
            and can focus on all-round learning.
