            <h2>What is Our Music Time?</h2>
            <p id="text-founder-en">
              OUR MUSIC TIME was founded in 2025 by Chiunglien Liu in San Jose,
              California. She is the CEO of OUR MUSIC TIME and the author of
              numerous books. In the 2000s, Chiunglien combined Eastern and
              Western cultures with her decades of teaching experience and
              pedagogical research, creating a solid foundation for students to
              learn music, particularly musicianship. Chiunglien's work
              gradually evolved to include the sharing of engaging and
              challenging activities with music educators. Her approach not only
              motivated teachers but also inspired students to immerse
              themselves in their instrument learning. By stimulating both the
              right and left hemispheres of the brain, Chiunglien's methods
              encourage physical engagement with music, fostering a holistic
              learning environment that emphasizes creativity alongside
              technical skill development.

        <h1>Our Publications</h1>
        <p>
          OUR MUSIC TIME has developed a spiral curriculum ("Beginner,
          Intermediate, and Advanced") for music teachers, designed to support
          both group and individual instrumental lessons. Inspired by the Kodály
          method, these materials aim to cultivate lifelong musical skills in
          children. The program encourages incorporating practical singing and
          listening exercises into existing lessons, following Kodály's
          three-step approach: Prepare, Present, and Practice.

            Have you wondered how to teach pitch and rhythm skills practically?
            Pitch and rhythm are abstract and complex concepts, but this
            significant resource of 'Song Picture Magnet' makes the concepts of
            duration and rhythm less abstract, more fun, and more concrete.
            Teach your children to feel the pitch and rhythm even on the staff
            by singing selected folk songs with Colorful Picture Cards and Song
            Lyric Posters. They are multi-level resources and great for both
            individual and group classes.
