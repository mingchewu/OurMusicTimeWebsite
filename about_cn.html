            <h2>Founder, Our Music Time</h2>
            <p>
              OUR MUSIC TIME was founded in 2025 by Chiunglien Liu in San Jose,
              California. She is the CEO of OUR MUSIC TIME and the author of
              numerous books. In the 2000s, Chiunglien combined Eastern and
              Western cultures with her decades of teaching experience and
              pedagogical research, creating a solid foundation for students to
              learn music, particularly musicianship. Chiunglien's work
              gradually evolved to include the sharing of engaging and
              challenging activities with music educators. Her approach not only
              motivated teachers but also inspired students to immerse
              themselves in their instrument learning. By stimulating both the
              right and left hemispheres of the brain, Chiunglien’s methods
              encourage physical engagement with music, fostering a holistic
              learning environment that emphasizes creativity alongside
              technical skill development.
